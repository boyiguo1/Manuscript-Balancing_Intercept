As the field of epidemiology evolves, there are growing interest to employ more computation approaches to solve analytic problems. Among them, simulation is one of the most accessible concept. Previous literature argues the importance of simulation in epidemiology education and research. While seeing th power of computational analytic tools, we caution the excess reliance on the computation in analytic problem solving and neglect of some fundamental statistics theory. In the article, we demonstrate how a simple and basic statistics knowledge can simply analytic problems by visiting a particular simulation problem, the balance intercept.

The balance intercept problem was first introduced by @rudolph2021 to addressed the problem of controlling the marginal probability of binary outcomes when constructing a simulation study. The authors proposed to numerically calculate the "balance intercept" to replace the standard intercept in simulation procedures. This same problem was later revisited by @robertson2021 who discovered that deriving the balance intercept analytically using @rudolph2021 can produce inaccurate estimation and hence unable to control the marginal probability at the desired level. Instead, @robertson2021 proposed a numeric solution to solve for the balance intercept for binomial simulation with a logistic link function. Later, @zivich2022 did xxx for multi-level categorical variable.

In the rest of this article, we look into the balance intercept problem with different statistical lenses. Specifically, we summarize what statistical problem the balance intercept manifest/represent, how the original authors set up the problem in a reference coding system, and how to translate the problem into the effect coding scope which provides a much simple solution without algorithmic integration.

[TODO: add what the problem is, what the authors problem. degree of freedom.]

The balance intercept is an adjustment to the conditional probability of the reference level of a categorical covariate. Nevertheless, both methods require extensive calculations, and there could be a more straightforward solution.

    based on the reference coding scheme

I proposed an alternative simulation strategy to control the marginal probability of a binary outcome. Instead of constructing the simulation based on the reference coding scheme, we encourage using effect coding, specifically deviation coding, to construct the design matrix of categorical covariates. The theoretical basis of this proposal is that the intercept term of the effect coding model (regardless of the link function or parametric assumptions) is the mean of the group means, which coincides with the marginal probability of a binary outcome when the groups are balanced. Hence, to simulate data from balanced designs, no additional calculation is needed compared to the previous proposals. In the case of unbalanced design, it is very intuitive to adjust the simulation equations and requires minimum arithmetic calculation. (See examples below) Besides its straightforwardness, the proposed solution should not incur any knowledge burden as the effect coding is commonly introduced in introductory statistics classes.
