As the field of epidemiology evolves, there are growing interest to employ more computational approaches to solve analytic problems. Among them, simulation is one of the most accessible concept. Previous literature argues the importance of simulation in epidemiology education and research. [TODO: add citations] Even though computational tools can be very helpful, we caution the excess reliance on the computation in analytic problem solving and the total neglect of fundamental statistics theories. In the article, we demonstrate how a basic statistics knowledge can simply the balance intercept problem and provide a generalized solution. In the rest of this article, we look into the balance intercept problem with different statistical lenses. Specifically, we summarize what statistical problem the balance intercept manifest/represent, how the original authors set up the problem in a reference coding system, and how to translate the problem into the effect coding scope which provides a much simple solution without algorithmic integration.

The balance intercept concept was first introduced by @rudolph2021 to control the marginal probability of binary outcomes when constructing a simulation study. The authors proposed to calculate a "balance intercept" to replace the "standard intercept" in simulation procedures. 

This same problem was later revisited by @robertson2021 who discovered that the analytic solution of the balance intercept analytically can produce inaccurate controlling of the marginal probability at the desired level. Instead, @robertson2021 proposed a numeric solution to solve for the balance intercept for binomial simulation with a logistic link function. Later, @zivich2022 did xxx for multi-level categorical variable. [TODO: add citence]

To better understand the balance intercept problem and the proposed simplification, we first introduce a basic statistics concept, coding scheme. A coding scheme describes how a categorical variable is enumerated in the regression system. Most commonly used coding schemes in analysis include reference coding (also known as dummy coding) and the effect coding. Both coding schemes create $p-1$ binary columns for a categorical variable with $p$ levels. The reference coding employs 0 and 1 to denote the level an individual belongs, while the effect coding normally employs 0, 1, and -1. As the enumerations are different for the two schemes, they offer different interpretations of regression coefficients. (See example in Table \ref{tab:code_scheme}) The reference coding emphasizes the change relative to a reference level of preference; the effect coding emphasizes the deviation from the grand mean (here refer to as the mean of the means). Nevertheless, the two schemes translate to each other one-on-one, and hence provide the same statistical inference. To note, both coding schemes can be applied ubiquitously in any regression system regardless the outcome distribution and the link function of choice. For more techinical details, we defer to [TODO: add textbook, probably INTRODUCING ANOVA and ANCOVA by andrew rutherford].
