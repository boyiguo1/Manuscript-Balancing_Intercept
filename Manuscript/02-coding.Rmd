The balance intercept problem embeds in the reference coding system in the original proposal to control the marginal probability, even though the authors didn't mention explicitly. The intercept term in the reference coding scheme describes the conditional probability of the reference level. Hence, Setting the intercept term to the target marginal probability (referred to as the standard intercept) would fail to control the empirical marginal probability due to the theoretical discrepancy. The balance intercept is a derivation of the conditional probability of the reference level, and can be calculated with previous solutions. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the simulation study would be vulnerable to the quality of numeric analysis and programming efficiency. 

The process of finding the balance intercept may not be necessary when the effect coding system, and hence greatly reduces the amount of numeric computation. The intercept term in the effect coding scheme describes the mean of the group means, which coincide with the marginal probability when the sample sizes are balanced across groups. In other words, the balance intercept problem does not exist for simulations with balanced designs. When the underlying design is not balanced, some simple arithmetic calculation is still needed to calculate the grand mean. However, this can be done easily with a closed form equation and applied to any data generating model of interest, following the mathematical definition of the intercept terms. Besides its straightforwardness, the proposed solution should not incur any knowledge burden as the effect coding is commonly introduced in introductory statistics classes. We demonstrate the simulation with the following toy example.
