In this report, we provide a statistics perspective to the balance intercept problem. Specifically, we clarify the simulation procedure when the reference coding scheme and the effect coding scheme are used as the foundation of the procedure. With an statistical analysis of the simulation procedure, we provide a generalized solution to calculate the balance intercept that addresses all forms of outcomes and link functions. We show that the balance intercept problem drastically simplifies when applying effect coding scheme. Notably, when the design of the study is balanced, there is minimum calculation is needed.

<!-- We provide preliminary evidence that the proposal works for both balanced and unbalanced designs via toy examples. Compared to the previous solutions that based on the reference coding scheme, our proposed solution requires less calculation than the approaches to derive analytic and numeric approximation of the balance point. Particularly, it requires modest calculation when the study design is balanced. -->

<!-- In this report, we only consider easy simulation scenarios, i.e. binary covariates, one covariate, identify link function, to demonstrate the feasibility of this simulation strategy. We anticipate with the levels of a covariate and the number of covariates growing, the calculation complexity would grow but still be manageable. We will provide a more delicate equation, particularly for the unbalanced design, to generalize for those situation. We will also conduct larger scale of simulation studies to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed solution. -->


In addition to the statistical solution for the balance intercept problem, we want to emphasize that the fundamental skills of statistics can not be ignored, even in the erra of computation. The growing computation power can greatly reduce the technical burden to derive analytic solutions with numeric devices. Nevertheless, the accuracy of numeric solution greatly depends on the perfection of the implementation, and can be easily overlooked. The fundamental statistics skills can provide a shortcut to the correct solution, and provide great translatability across programming languages in comparison to numeric solutions. The author doesnâ€™t arugula if analytic approach and computational approach is superior. Instead, we advocate for a balanced emphasis on both computational skills and analytic thinking. 




<!-- The reason why this is necessary -->
<!-- * significantly reduces the complexity of the problem, leveraging a statistics concept covered in the introductory level statistics class -->
<!-- * Require less numeric programming, which can easily produce errors for people without numeric programming background. -->
<!-- The simulation strategy translates easily to other programming e.g. *SAS*, *STATA*, whose implementations are not shown in this article.  -->



<!-- An alternative simulation strategy to control the marginal probability of a binary outcome. Instead of constructing the simulation based on the reference coding scheme, we encourage using effect coding, specifically deviation coding, to construct the design matrix of categorical covariates. The theoretical basis of this proposal is that the intercept term of the effect coding model (regardless of the link function or parametric assumptions) is the mean of the group means, which coincides with the marginal probability of a binary outcome when the groups are balanced. Hence, to simulate data from balanced designs, no additional calculation is needed compared to the previous proposals. In the case of unbalanced design, it is very intuitive to adjust the simulation equations and requires minimum arithmetic calculation. (See examples below)  -->
